# LatTrace — A Smart Digital Mapping Platform for Land Ownership & Planning

🗺️ LatTrace — Intelligent Land Mapping & Parcel Management
LatTrace is a smart geospatial platform built to digitally map, trace, and manage land parcels with precision and transparency. Designed for governments, communities, planners, and developers, LatTrace enables secure access to land ownership data, boundaries, and planning insights — all from an interactive digital map.

Whether you’re mapping a rural village or digitizing an urban registry, LatTrace helps you visualize land as it truly exists.
